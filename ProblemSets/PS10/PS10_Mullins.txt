\section{Results Findings}
For out-of-sample test results, we see that they are all to an accuracy of ~ 90 percent, given to us by the f1 score each reported. With the best score going to Neural Network Algorithm and the worst being Naive Bayes (sadly). Since we are looking to determine whether or not someone has is a high-earner, I would say, depending on the sample size, all of the different methods would be nearly identical in effectiveness. Based on our tolerance level, 90 percent accuracy seems like a great place to start with these learning methods

For the geometric mean results, we have more variance between our 6 learning algorithms, ranging from the highest of 0.756 for Nueral Networks and the lowest being 0.673 for the Tree Model. I believe that this is indicating that the high-earners are equal to or above this percentage in the population. In other words, we would expect the number of high-earners in the sample to be above a percentage around 0.67-75. Or, that ~ 25 percent of the sample is being classified as a high-earner.
