1.

2. I think it would be interesting to look at how Twitter can be used as a tool to increase stock prices during an acquisition. I would use a combination of scarping tweets related to specific acquisitions or investments and combine that with the stock prices over the same range of days and perhaps further to see how the performance continues after the hype decreases.
